The model suggests the optimal starting time for electric vehicles to minimize the user's charging cost, considering the Time-of-use tariff scheme
###  Problem
The world is experiencing a global transition from fuel-based mobility to zero-emission mobility. The number of electric car registrations quadrupled within three years (2019-2021) and its market share hit a new record of 19.2% in the EU market as of April 2023. Large-scale adoption of EVs in the near future is foreseeable amidst the growing climate-conscious population. However, the transition brings about some systematic challenges:
- Consumer side: charging infrastructure
- Supplier side: a surge in electricity consumption at peak hours can threaten the grid's stability, e.g., unacceptable voltage fluctuation.
