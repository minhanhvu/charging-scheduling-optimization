### üçâSUMMARY
This project presents a charging scheduling algorithm that helps balance the electrical system and minimize the cost of charging for e-car users. It is designed to satisfy the e-car's energy request before its departure by determining the optimal charging start time and charging speed. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using a set of 6 simulated charging instances, where the charging behaviors are derived from real-world workplace stations. The outputs prove that the algorithm is logical, cost-effective, and straightforward to implement.
