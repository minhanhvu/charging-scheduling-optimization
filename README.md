# Charging-Scheduling-Optimization
The model suggests the optimal starting time for electric vehicles to minimize the user's charging cost, considering the Time-of-use tariff scheme
###  Problem
Amidst the growing climate-conscious population and the government incentives for electric vehicles (EVs), large-scale adoption of EVs in the near future is foreseeable. Electric car registrations have quadrupled within just three years (2019-2021) and its market share hit a new record of 19.2% in the EU as of April 2023. However, the transition to electric vehicles poses some challenges:
- Charging behavior understanding: where, when, and how often EV's owners charge their vehicles? How the charging infrastructure networks can be designed the best support the charging access. This is the key to avoiding charging inconvenience, which is a barrier to both adoption and continued use of EVs. 
- Grid's stability: a surge in electricity consumption due to EV charging at peak hours can threaten the grid operation, e.g., unacceptable voltage fluctuation.
